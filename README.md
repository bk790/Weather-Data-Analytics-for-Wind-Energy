# Weather-Data-Analytics-for-Wind-Energy

Our current energy landscape is dominated by traditional sources, leaving a vast array of cleaner, renewable options underutilized in most households. This dependence not only hinders our ability to achieve self-reliance and long-term sustainability, but also leads to the underutilization of a vast array of cleaner and more renewable options. This project seeks to address this imbalance by investigating the feasibility of harnessing wind energy within our university's vicinity. Our goal is to explore the potential of wind as a complementary power source, ultimately aiming to create a comprehensive renewable energy plan for the entire university area.

This project focuses on three key aspects. Firstly, we aim to shift our university towards a model of self-reliance and sustainability. By embracing renewable energy sources like wind, we can reduce our dependence on conventional power grids and contribute to a greener future for our institution. Secondly, the project seeks to unlock the vast potential of renewable energy sources. Many households remain unaware of the abundant renewable options readily available. This project will showcase the power of wind energy and demonstrate its potential for significant energy production within our university. Finally, we will optimize energy production by analyzing the feasibility of wind energy in our specific location.

By thoroughly investigating the viability of wind energy, this project paves the way for a more sustainable and self-sufficient future for our university. It also serves as a model for wider adoption of renewable resources in our community, inspiring a shift towards a cleaner and more environmentally conscious future.

We focused on collecting and analyzing data regarding wind magnitude and direction around the DUK campus. Utilizing NASA Earth Power’s Data Access Viewer[1], we gathered wind data by inputting specific parameters such as latitude (8.62°N), longitude (76.85°E), and the time frame from January 2010 to March 2024. This data, including wind direction and speed, was save in CSV format for further analysis.

NASA Earth Power (NEP) serves as a valuable resource for our wind data due to several key factors. Firstly, NEP boasts global coverage, providing data across a vast geographical area. This makes it ideal for university studies regardless of location. Secondly, NEP's data is specifically tailored to support applications in the renewable energy sector, including wind power generation assessments. This focus on renewables ensures the data is directly relevant to our project's goals. Finally, NEP offers publicly available data, making it a cost-effective choice for university research projects.

It's important to note that NEP doesn't directly collect wind data itself. Instead, it utilizes two primary methods:

Satellite Observations: Satellites measure outgoing Earth radiation. This data is then fed into radiative transfer models to infer wind data.

Weather Models: Data from NASA's atmospheric assimilation models, like MERRA-2, is also incorporated into the final wind data products.

Initially, we conducted a preliminary exploratory data analysis using Google Colab to obtain a broad overview of the collected data. Subsequently, we organized the data into yearly segments, divided into four parts: January to March, April to June, July to September, and October to December. By categorizing the data in this manner, we aimed to identify seasonal trends and patterns in wind behaviour up to the year 2023.

We specifically focused on analyzing wind patterns in the x and y directions, as wind movement in the z direction was deemed irrelevant for our purposes. This approach enabled us to visualize and interpret the temporal dynamics of wind behaviour within our selected area. By gaining insights into local climate patterns, we sought to uncover potential implications for various applications, particularly in the realm of renewable energy. Additionally, we conducted statistical analyses to quantify the variability and consistency of wind speed and direction across different seasons and years. This comprehensive approach allowed us to assess the viability of wind energy generation at the DUK Campus and provided valuable insights for future research and development in sustainable energy solutions.
